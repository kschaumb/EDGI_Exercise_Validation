<h1>Preliminary Aim - Develop a scoring algorithm</h1>
<p>The first aim of this paper is to develop a scoring algorithm for a ED100k exercise items in an ED sample based on theoretical literature and available ED100k items which captures and defines rates of:</p>
<p>1. Compulsive Exercise</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Ever and Regular Compulsive Exercise</p></li>
<li><p>Current Compulsive Exercise</p></li>
</ul>
<p>2. Exercise Addiction</p>
<p>3. Excessive Exercise</p>
<p>4. Compensatory Exercise</p>
<p>5. Maladaptive Exercise (Broad)</p>
<section id="scoring" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scoring">Scoring</h2>
<p>The ED100k included 12 questions regarding maladaptive exercise. The first question which all participants were asked, inquires as to whether individuals ever exercised to intentionally control weight and shape (Q1). Only those who endorsed EVER Exercising to intentionally control weight or shape were asked to respond to two additional questions which asked about exercise in more detail, including two questions (Q2, Q3) about whether individuals ever felt compelled to exercise and whether they felt uneasy or distressed if unable to exercise. In a third step, those who reported ever exercising to intentionally control weight and shape and answered ‘Yes’ to either Q2 or Q3 were additionally asked three questions (Q4-Q6) about whether exercise interfered with life activities or diet, along with questions regarding the onset (Q7), duration (Q8), and frequency (Q9) of their compulsive exercise, along with whether they engaged in the behavior currently (Q10) and the last age at which they engaged in the behavior (Q11). In a separate section, all participants were asked whether they had ‘exercised excessively’ specifically to <em>compensate</em> for episodes of binge eating or overeating (Q12). During recoding, those (n = 945) who reported no to Q1 - exercise to control shape and weight, were marked as ‘0’ for follow-up questions. Those who reported that they had engaged in exercise to for weight and shape control but ‘No’ to both Q2 &amp; Q3 (n = 200) were marked as ‘0’ for Q4-Q11.</p>
<p>Scoring algorithms for each subconstruct are presented in Table 1.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sensitivity-of-q1---excessive-exercise">Sensitivity of Q1 - Excessive Exercise</h2>
<p>Overall, there was high convergent validity for Q1 with Q2-Q6. Specifically, individuals eating disorders who endorse using exercise to intentionally control weight ‘more often’ are indeed highly likely to engage in this behavior for a substantive period of time (xx% of those reporting exercise to intentionally control weight ‘more often’ reported a duration of compulsive exercise &gt; 3 months; a time period of equivalent to diagnostic levels of other intentional weight control behaviors), and to report symptoms consistent with a definition of both compulsive and addictive exercise. Regarding the sensitivity of Q1 to detect compulsive, addictive, and excessive exericse, xxxx (add confusion matrix statistics here). Overall, the vast majority of individuals with eating disorders who reporting regular exercise for weight loss to control weight and shape report that this exercise was compulsive, and that they also experienced life interfering sequellae of this behavior. Regarding specific addictive exercise symptoms, the modal number of exercise interference items was all 3. Findings suggest high sensitivity of Q1 to additional follow-up questions regarding addictive and compulsive exercise, with slightly less sensitivity to excessive exercise (high frequency)</p>
<p>With regards to compensatory exercise, about (61.38)% of individuals who reported maladpative exercising ‘more often’ in Q1 also reported a history of compensatory exercise (sensitivity = ). Among the group reporting compensatory exercise, xx% reported exercising for weight loss at all in Q1, (NPV = ), and xx% reported exercising for weight loss ‘more often’ in Q1 (NPV = ). In sum, compensatory exercise was common, but somewhat less prevalent than other maladaptive exercise behaviors, and there was high sensitivity to detect compensatory exercise for those who reported any exercise for weight control in Q1.</p>
